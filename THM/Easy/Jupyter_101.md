A friendly introduction into using the Jupyter Notebook environment. Learn to process and visualise data!

This is a Data Science related room...

## Task 1 - Preface

Only reading...

## Task 2 - What is Jupyter? 

Only reading...

## Task 3 - Deploying Instance & Logging In 

The description says that I need to wait 5 minutes for the machine to boot correctly...

It also says that we have to:

**Use the password: *tryhackme***

Target IP: 10.10.111.168

I do the initial ennumeration with nmap:

**nmap -sV -A 10.10.111.168**

I open the URL in port 80:

**http://10.10.111.168/**

And I get the login page, asking only for a "Password". I enter the one provided by the task description "tryhackme".

I get the "Home Page - Select or create a Notebook" page.

The link to the supporting material in the task description is dead...

## Task 4 - LetÂ´s learn More About Jupiter

Task Description:

> Enter the "WhatIsJupyter" directory and launch "WhatIsJupyter.ipynb" and have a read through.<br>
> There's no questions, but I detail some use cases of Jupyter and why someone might use it over an IDLE such as PyCharm! 


Not much to do here, just reading...

## Task 5 - Understanding how Jupiter Notebooks Run
